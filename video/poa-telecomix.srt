1
00:00:01,498 --> 00:00:05,995
I will talk a bit about what Telecomix really is,

2
00:00:06,743 --> 00:00:10,641
... generally, and so...

3
00:00:10,995 --> 00:00:13,750
This is our logo.

4
00:00:17,471 --> 00:00:20,375
There is some symbolism in it,

5
00:00:20,558 --> 00:00:28,927
but there is quite a lot.
We have written about it on Wikipedia.

6
00:00:29,951 --> 00:00:37,591
My name is Elis, I live in Stockholm,
I have ham radio signal SA0BSE.

7
00:00:37,997 --> 00:00:42,331
I am an operator on Telecomix IRC.

8
00:00:44,363 --> 00:00:48,466
Telecomix has been nicknamed quite
a lot during the years,

9
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:58,682
"Socio-cybernetic jellyfish cluster" being one
of the most tenacious attibutions we've had,

10
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:04,074
"True Internet Heroes" was used this spring
when I was in Brussels.

11
00:01:04,307 --> 00:01:09,000
I had my laptop under my arm when a guy
came up to me and said:

12
00:01:13,426 --> 00:01:15,498
It was kind of a "wow"-feeling,

13
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:26,862
"Telecommunist Cluster" we have seen
recently in online articles.

14
00:01:27,223 --> 00:01:34,437
We have made some fun about communism and so on

15
00:01:34,741 --> 00:01:40,707
Tech Support for North Africa.
There has been some cases during the spring -

16
00:01:40,707 --> 00:01:43,274
- that most of you have probably heard about.

17
00:01:45,704 --> 00:01:49,472
What is Telecomix? That's a difficult question -

18
00:01:49,936 --> 00:01:51,984
- and there is no definitive answer.

19
00:01:52,249 --> 00:01:56,425
We have an IRC network.

20
00:01:56,457 --> 00:02:01,536
It is often looked upon as a meeting spot -

21
00:02:01,537 --> 00:02:06,464
- where people with shared interests
meet to talk, have fun, and -

22
00:02:06,465 --> 00:02:08,980
- do different things if they feel like it.

23
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:11,909
Projects are often initiated -

24
00:02:12,149 --> 00:02:15,709
- with different goals for different cases.

25
00:02:16,407 --> 00:02:20,964
I will talk about the different projects in a bit.

26
00:02:28,085 --> 00:02:33,737
Eh, mac keyboard. Jellyfish - we use it quite often

27
00:02:36,008 --> 00:02:38,144
They swim in clusters -

28
00:02:38,552 --> 00:02:41,088
- and follow each other.

29
00:02:41,384 --> 00:02:44,141
They are generally fine.

30
00:02:45,784 --> 00:02:50,008
Power of Adhocracy, that is the
name of the conference.

31
00:02:50,601 --> 00:02:57,615
We have even called it do-ocracy a bit.
Those who do, do.

32
00:02:58,143 --> 00:03:07,032
Those who want to do stuff start projects
and start working toward change.

33
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:13,091
Because they feel like it.

34
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:19,699
Most Telecomix business is done
because people think it is fun.

35
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:25,155
There is not a lot of incentive otherwise.

36
00:03:29,474 --> 00:03:34,323
These are the three steps through which
Telecomix projects are usually started.

37
00:03:34,605 --> 00:03:42,261
People are hanging on our channel. Something that
we don't like comes in; stuff that we want to fix.

38
00:03:42,645 --> 00:03:46,885
- and then we will start a project for it.

39
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:52,236
One example is the Egypt project -

40
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:54,684
- that became rather large.

41
00:03:55,093 --> 00:03:59,125
There has been a lot of other projects.

42
00:04:00,556 --> 00:04:07,020
It works, too! Much more efficiently than
I thought in the beginning.

43
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:12,316
People like doing stuff as long as we make sure it's fun.

44
00:04:13,604 --> 00:04:17,076
As long as it's nice there will always be a driving force.

45
00:04:22,452 --> 00:04:25,028
Here are some examples of stuff we've done.

46
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:33,042
Telecomix has done some lobby work
in EU and Sweden during the years -

47
00:04:33,275 --> 00:04:38,384
together with French and German groups.

48
00:04:38,968 --> 00:04:43,275
We have been mailing and talking to politicians, -

49
00:04:43,474 --> 00:04:46,719
- answer to department referrals, sending in paper, -

50
00:04:46,951 --> 00:04:49,679
and a lot of stuff like that.

51
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:58,667
Last year in December I and few others
in the audience did a lot of Wikileaks mirroring.

52
00:05:00,974 --> 00:05:05,135
Then we have the Egypt project -

53
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:08,727
- that became pretty big and known -

54
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:11,917
- where we helped to set up internet in Egypt.

55
00:05:13,941 --> 00:05:17,884
And a lot of other stuff in that area.

56
00:05:18,364 --> 00:05:23,583
The Syria project is going on right now.

57
00:05:24,965 --> 00:05:27,876
I will get around to that, too.

58
00:05:30,989 --> 00:05:33,821
Wikileaks mirroring.

59
00:05:34,284 --> 00:05:41,525
December 3rd I woke up to the message
"Wikileaks is down".

60
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:45,943
We started to investigate it and discovered
that the DNS were being DDoSed.

61
00:05:47,703 --> 00:05:51,443
So you could not resolve the  servers.

62
00:05:52,276 --> 00:05:57,668
After some Twitter work and looking around online -

63
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:02,924
- we found a computer that had its Cablegate archive.

64
00:06:04,353 --> 00:06:06,457
We mirrored it -

65
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:10,434
- and talked about it on the Internet
"Here's a copy of everything" -

66
00:06:10,706 --> 00:06:13,769
- use this one. Copy it too, if you like.

67
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:20,638
That evening like 57 mirrors had emerged,
depending on how you look at it.

68
00:06:21,572 --> 00:06:23,467
This was a Friday.

69
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:28,907
During the weekend Wikileaks presented
its mass-mirroring project, -

70
00:06:29,107 --> 00:06:32,598
to auto-mirror and auto-update mirrors.

71
00:06:33,522 --> 00:06:41,388
Toward the end of next week there were
over 2000 mirrors.

72
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,880
It is difficult to name them all here.

73
00:06:46,068 --> 00:06:49,291
That was a quite exciting project, -

74
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:55,853
and during that project we found that
it wasn't only the mirroring that was the issue.

75
00:06:55,854 --> 00:07:00,558
There were some cases about bad
behavior from among others Paypal.

76
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:08,312
Like, freezing the account.
There were several others doing things like that.

77
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,967
Flattr were the only ones who stood strong -

78
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:17,728
- during that period, and they have
even continued doing that afterwards.

79
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:23,561
I have a nice picture from this winter.

80
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:28,777
It hasn't really been documented like
that, but it is cute nonetheless.

81
00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:37,119
I don't think it'll look like that om 50 years,
but it's cool still.

82
00:07:40,087 --> 00:07:47,023
Egypt. Yeah, we had a number of projects.
This is definitely not a complete list.

83
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:50,086
But I thought I should talk a bit about them.

84
00:07:50,087 --> 00:07:54,520
The modem project. We set up modem pools.

85
00:07:54,676 --> 00:08:02,156
We did that by talking to ISP and administer
the handling of the phone numbers, -

86
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,853
- and to get them down to Egypt
in various different ways.

87
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:10,739
That took a lot of administration to do, -

88
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:18,258
- but our lines were crammed, constantly.
They were rung down.

89
00:08:18,474 --> 00:08:23,484
There is no way to 100% verify that
everything came from Egypt, but -

90
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:27,944
- we can assume a large part of it did.

91
00:08:28,162 --> 00:08:34,314
That's the impression we got from the
people we talked to, at least.

92
00:08:37,257 --> 00:08:47,452
I started an amateur radio project
where we tried to set up listening posts

93
00:08:47,453 --> 00:08:49,312
on the amateur radio band.

94
00:08:50,236 --> 00:08:56,795
On specific frequencies that are
often used in the ham radio community.

95
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:03,915
Then we went on to stream out
everything that was sent on those bands -

96
00:09:04,632 --> 00:09:11,584
- that reached our stations via internet and web radio.
We had around 100-200 listeners, -

97
00:09:11,823 --> 00:09:16,935
who listened to static for hours
during the period, -

98
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,074
- in the hopes that they would catch
some telegraphy.

99
00:09:21,923 --> 00:09:26,603
We got one telegraphy, actually.
Although not so much, -

100
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,282
- and we could not verify its origin.

101
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,852
The biggest problem we
had with that project was that -

102
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,957
- there exists only 140 radio
amateurs in total in Egypt.

103
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:49,748
It is a very small number, and all
of them turned out to be educated by the army.

104
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,243
So I don't think that group of people -

105
00:09:54,524 --> 00:10:04,116
is the group that will broadcast on SOS
frequencies needing help, -

106
00:10:04,348 --> 00:10:06,420
- when they are presumably
working for the army.

107
00:10:07,588 --> 00:10:13,501
But it was a very exciting project.
We repolished an old tech -

108
00:10:13,844 --> 00:10:18,033
and showed that it still
exists and is usable.

109
00:10:18,349 --> 00:10:23,509
It is out of band communication, and it is
something that is always nice to be able to use.

110
00:10:25,412 --> 00:10:27,453
The fax project.

111
00:10:28,244 --> 00:10:35,508
It was pretty much done with Google.
Finding fax numbers in Egypt -

112
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:41,120
- and then fax information flyers to all
faxes in the entire country.

113
00:10:42,202 --> 00:10:51,258
We did that. It seemed that most of it
arrived. Some of it probably disappeared.

114
00:10:51,671 --> 00:10:54,102
We don't know if we found all the fax numbers, -

115
00:10:54,302 --> 00:10:57,055
that's a lot of guesswork, basically.

116
00:10:58,807 --> 00:11:04,464
But it's also an interesting project about
stuff that is actually possible to do, -

117
00:11:04,928 --> 00:11:08,215
- without even leaving one's apartment.

118
00:11:10,474 --> 00:11:12,624
IP Scan project.

119
00:11:13,051 --> 00:11:17,842
We had three persons scanning the
entire Egyptian IP range, -

120
00:11:18,235 --> 00:11:23,084
- for addresses that were up and active, -

121
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:27,548
- and then we did a port scan over
all the addresses that were up, -

122
00:11:28,194 --> 00:11:35,865
and sent forged HTTP requests to all
webservers throughout the nation -

123
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:45,987
- that contained messages in its request
header instead of POST or GET.

124
00:11:46,001 --> 00:11:48,089
Like, "we have modem pools"

125
00:11:48,562 --> 00:11:50,643
- and that kind of messages.

126
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,298
This was a project that took a lot of time, -

127
00:11:54,536 --> 00:11:58,417
- and those who worked on it were very
skilled. I was not one of them.

128
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:06,363
This was a rather successful project, because -

129
00:12:06,364 --> 00:12:11,698
- the Egyptians hadn't shut down their
entire internet, just parts of it.

130
00:12:12,962 --> 00:12:16,057
So it worked rather well.

131
00:12:16,358 --> 00:12:21,119
Egypt had shut down the internet for
the majority of the population, -

132
00:12:21,247 --> 00:12:28,015
- but they hadn't shut down the internet
for 5-star hotels or companies.

133
00:12:28,471 --> 00:12:36,454
Basically so they wouldn't affect
businesses too much.

134
00:12:37,077 --> 00:12:40,007
But it turned out to be cumbersome
for them in the end.

135
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:45,530
When people exploited the holes that were.

136
00:12:46,287 --> 00:12:53,364
Since then, in Sweden we have done
a lot of work to talk with news stations, -

137
00:12:53,444 --> 00:12:55,972
to have them report on the news
that we have received.

138
00:12:56,243 --> 00:13:01,587
We had some intensive weeks when
we were on TV on a number of occasions, -

139
00:13:01,987 --> 00:13:11,187
both on SVT, ABC nyheterne and Rapport.
Different parts of Telecomix were present.

140
00:13:13,848 --> 00:13:17,657
We talked about stuff that was happening
and what we had done, -

141
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:19,742
- and what we would continue to do.

142
00:13:20,616 --> 00:13:24,363
Then we worked a lot with these four
information channels -

143
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,016
- distributing information, in order
to get information down to Egypt.

144
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:37,169
First aid information; all sorts of info
that is usable in hectic situations.

145
00:13:38,071 --> 00:13:45,872
From what we have heard, people were
benefiting. But you never really know for sure.

146
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,629
Anyone can come forth and say stuff.

147
00:13:54,964 --> 00:13:59,437
Syria... It is active right now, -

148
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:02,081
I won't say a lot about that.

149
00:14:02,692 --> 00:14:09,230
There was a lot of BlueCoat logs the
other week. 54 gigs or something, -

150
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:15,125
I haven't been involved in the
Syria project myself, -

151
00:14:15,485 --> 00:14:18,607
- there have been other people
working on that.

152
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:23,489
Telecomix is a lot about "those wo do
are the ones that lead."

153
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,718
And I haven't done anything
in that project, so...

154
00:14:28,198 --> 00:14:29,990
Not my project.

155
00:14:30,517 --> 00:14:34,381
But they seem to be very skilled
at what they're doing.

156
00:14:34,901 --> 00:14:39,766
It is going to be interesting for both me
and probably many of you -

157
00:14:40,057 --> 00:14:45,289
- to see how it goes for them.
It's a promising project, -

158
00:14:46,601 --> 00:14:48,913
- and no one knows how
it is going to work out.

159
00:14:52,787 --> 00:14:56,966
Then, we have not only done large things,
we have also worked with smaller projects.

160
00:14:58,206 --> 00:15:04,054
Telecomix isn't all about big projects
and huge workloads and big things, -

161
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:08,784
- it needs to be fun. If it isn't fun,
then nobody is going to work on it.

162
00:15:10,787 --> 00:15:17,955
The driving force is that is has to be fun,
and that others can benefit from it.

163
00:15:20,982 --> 00:15:25,918
We're running our chat network.
We think it is nice to talk there, -

164
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:30,493
- uncontrolled, of course.

165
00:15:32,277 --> 00:15:39,101
And we have a Jabber server.
Lots of small projects.

166
00:15:39,978 --> 00:15:48,305
Then we have the DNS project, which
also is very interesting.

167
00:15:49,597 --> 00:15:51,506
But I don't know how many people are
working on it right now.

168
00:15:51,804 --> 00:15:53,324
It's not my project either.

169
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:59,275
Telecomix is very divided in terms of what
projects individual people devote their time to.

170
00:15:59,276 --> 00:16:03,000
Everybody is definitely not
involved in everything.

171
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,239
That would be quite a lot of work
for that one person.

172
00:16:09,185 --> 00:16:12,085
But that's how it works anyway, -

173
00:16:12,049 --> 00:16:16,321
Those who can their parts talk about their parts.

174
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:23,322
I have, for example, done everything
concerning the stickers -

175
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:31,832
- that we have distributed today.
I started with this last spring, -

176
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:35,920
and those that have been given out
today are generation three.

177
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:44,639
And... Yeah, they have improved.

178
00:16:46,911 --> 00:16:53,041
Some links: Telecomix chat, wiki, -

179
00:16:53,686 --> 00:16:56,277
and then a little about me and who I am.

180
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:04,070
If anybody has questions after the talk,
go there to find contact information for me.

181
00:17:04,485 --> 00:17:13,549
Then there is always the chat. It is basically
active every hour of the day.

182
00:17:14,471 --> 00:17:22,126
Everybody is welcome there. It's a cool 
place to hang. I can recommend it.

183
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:25,537
Questions?

184
00:17:38,264 --> 00:17:42,417
We never succeeded in finding out 
who DDoSed Wikileaks.

185
00:17:42,636 --> 00:17:47,585
There was some suspicion, but we 
could never determine it for sure.

186
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:51,483
Our involvement was mostly in 
mirroring the stuff,

187
00:17:51,724 --> 00:17:56,076
and then it ended up being so big
that it couldn't be taken down.

188
00:18:13,902 --> 00:18:16,736
The logo? Yeah, we can say a lot about that.

189
00:18:16,894 --> 00:18:21,398
Whoops, we looped.

190
00:18:22,674 --> 00:18:27,970
We have Omega, that's about resistance.

191
00:18:28,186 --> 00:18:33,855
Ohms law, that is well-known for many.

192
00:18:33,856 --> 00:18:40,976
Internet activism is very much about
resistance towards the rest of the community.

193
00:18:41,229 --> 00:18:46,788
We want to change, so we are
resistant towards stuff thats happening.

194
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,895
The lightnings are from the old Televerket
[telecommunications company]

195
00:18:52,149 --> 00:18:55,566
There was some people asking 
about that outside, too.

196
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:06,575
The pyramid... Illuminati as we
say. Pyramids are nice.

197
00:19:08,629 --> 00:19:13,557
I haven't seen anything about Illuminati
in any Telecomix business.

198
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:20,038
And the star; that is communism. That 
can also be fine sometimes.

199
00:19:22,737 --> 00:19:29,017
It is more about being fun than
being serious, -

200
00:19:29,018 --> 00:19:31,514
- according to me.

201
00:19:37,402 --> 00:19:40,377
Any more questions?

202
00:19:40,403 --> 00:19:42,882
None?

203
00:19:55,297 --> 00:19:58,338
Then I suppose we can end this...

204
00:20:00,861 --> 00:20:07,485
Well, people can ask me after
the talk. I will be here all night.

205
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:14,212
Then I'm also on IRC. Telecomix IRC.
